# Custom Template Documentation


## IDX Broker uses Twig for templates
What is Twig?

> Twig is a modern template engine for PHP. Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code. The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.



## Basic usage with IDX Broker
1. Use the example template in this repo
2. Modify as needed
3. Submit to developers@idxbroker.com for review

----

### Requirements and things to remember

* This is for IDX Broker Partners ONLY. Clients will not be allowed to create templates.

* Because we are not writing these templates, IDX Broker will not be supporting them.

* Currently there is no way to restrict a client for getting your template should you offer and removing the template if they leave your dev code.

* Versioning is not completely supported at this time. Like I mentioned this is very new and this likely going to prove something we need to re think and work out.

* IDX Broker will not be involved in any disputes over templates.

* IDX Broker Original is not supported for custom templates




>This offering is still in alpha stage and will be evolving.
