What is Twig?

> Twig is a modern template engine for PHP. Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code. The overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very minimum.



## Basic usage with IDX Broker
1. Use the sample-twig file in this repo
2. Modify as needed
3. Submit to developers@idxbroker.com for review

### Requirements and things to remember

* This is for IDX Broker Partners ONLY. Clients will not be allowed to create templates.
* Because we are not writing these templates, IDX Broker will not be supporting them.
* There is no way of removing a template if a client leaves your dev code.
* All macros regarding disclaimers or courtesies will be required even the MLS does not provide disclaimers or courtesies
* Versioning is not completely supported at this time.
* Currently there is no way to restrict a client for getting your template should you offer and removing the template if they leave your dev code.
* Versioning is not completely supported at this time. This is very new and this likely going to prove something we need to re think and work out.
* IDX Broker will not be involved in any disputes over templates.
